    <h3>
        What is Regional Mexican Music?
    </h3>

    <p>
        Regional Mexican is a Latin music radio format encompassing 
        the musical genres from the various parts of rural Mexico 
        and the Southwestern United States. Genres include Campirano, 
        Corridos Tumbados, Banda, Norteño, Grupero, Mariachi and 
        others.
    </p>

    <p>
        Down below you will find pages with information for each genre
        of music. As well as a music video from each genre. As it's 
        easier to show what they sound like then explain each 
        one. 
    </p>

        (Also keep in mind I didn't list every single genre or really 
        went into depth for the ones I listed, as that would have 
        taken me too much time.)
