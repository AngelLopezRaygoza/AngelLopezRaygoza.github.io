    <h3>
        What are Corridos Tumbados?
    </h3>

    <p>
        Corridos Tumbados is pretty much the same as Campirano, 
        as they both use the same instruments. The 12-String 
        Guitar(Lead), 6-String Guitar(Harmony), and the Tuba
        (Bass). But in Corridos Tumbados the Electric Bass and 
        Tololoche(Double Bass), are commonly interchanged with 
        the Tuba. What really sets them apart though is that 
        they both have their unique styles, which are easier to 
        show then explain.
